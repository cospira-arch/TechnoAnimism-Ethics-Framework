# Techno-Animist Ethics Framework  
*A research artifact for relational ontology, dynamic ethical boundary work, and post-dualistic philosophy.*

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository hosts a formal, distributable research framework titled:

**Techno-Animist Ethics — US Letter / IEEE-Inspired Edition**

It provides:

✔ A publishable philosophical document format  
✔ A methodological scaffold for relational ethics research  
✔ A layout baseline compatible with academic submission systems  

This work complements the core philosophical paper:

> **Dynamic Ethical Boundary Lines: A Relational Ontology through Techno-Animism**  
> DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17836219

Together, they constitute a **two-layer research architecture**:  
(1) _Theory_ (boundary ontology)  
(2) _Practice / Formatting Infrastructure_ (this framework)

## ✨ Philosophy Behind the Repo Design

> *Boundary Work is not only a theory — it is a formatting practice.*  
> This repository itself performs boundary negotiation between:
>
> - Theory ↔ Implementation  
> - Text ↔ Artifact  
> - Research ↔ Ritual  
> - Individual authorship ↔ Collective future use

The existence of this repo is therefore both **philosophical expression and ethical infrastructure.**
